# Python-Challenge

In this project i got two cases
lets call them PyBank and PyPoll. ill explain them shortly

in the PyBank i were tasked to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of my company:

My task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
The total number of months included in the dataset
The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

And this were the results 

Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22564198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)

The dataset encompasses a total of 86 months, revealing a net total profit/loss of $22,564,198. 
On average, the monthly changes in loss to a decrease of $8,311.11.
The most significant increase in profits was in August 2016, with a rise of $1,862,002. 
While the largest decrease was in February 2014, with a drop of $1,825,558.

PyPoll

In this Challenge, i was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
The total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
The percentage of votes each candidate won
The total number of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote

Your analysis should align with the following results:
